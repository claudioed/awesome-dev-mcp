# Debugging Methodology

## 1. Understand the Problem
- What is the expected behavior?
- What is the actual behavior?
- When did the issue start occurring?
- Can you reproduce the issue consistently?

## 2. Gather Information
- Check error messages and logs
- Identify the scope of the issue
- Document the steps to reproduce
- Note any recent changes to the codebase

## 3. Form Hypotheses
- What could be causing this issue?
- List potential root causes
- Prioritize hypotheses by likelihood

## 4. Test Hypotheses
- Use debugging tools (debugger, print statements, logging)
- Test one hypothesis at a time
- Isolate variables and test components separately
- Use binary search to narrow down the problem area

## 5. Common Debugging Techniques
- Rubber duck debugging - explain the problem out loud
- Add logging and print statements strategically
- Use a debugger to step through code
- Check assumptions and validate inputs
- Review recent changes and git history
- Test with different inputs and edge cases

## 6. Verify the Fix
- Confirm the issue is resolved
- Test related functionality
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document the solution

# Git Workflow Best Practices

## Basic Workflow
1. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make changes and commit frequently
4. Push to remote: `git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Create pull request for review
6. Merge after approval and delete feature branch

## Commit Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Commit frequently but push when ready

## Common Git Commands
```bash
# Status and information
git status                  # Show working tree status
git log --oneline          # Show commit history
git diff                   # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged          # Show staged changes

# Staging and committing
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git add <file>             # Stage specific file
git commit -m "message"    # Commit with message
git commit --amend         # Modify last commit

# Branching
git branch                 # List branches
git checkout -b <branch>   # Create and switch to branch
git checkout <branch>      # Switch to existing branch
git branch -d <branch>     # Delete merged branch

# Remote operations
git push origin <branch>   # Push branch to remote
git pull                   # Fetch and merge from remote
git fetch                  # Fetch from remote without merging
```

## Merge Conflicts
1. Pull latest changes
2. Git will mark conflicted files
3. Edit files to resolve conflicts
4. Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
5. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
6. Complete merge: `git commit`

## MCP Server Organization Strategies

### Option 1: Monolithic Structure
- Single server.py file with all tools/prompts/resources
- Good for: Small servers, rapid prototyping
- Pros: Simple, easy to understand
- Cons: Hard to maintain as it grows

### Option 2: Modular Structure
```
mcp-server/
├── server.py (main entry point)
├── tools/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── file_tools.py
│   ├── system_tools.py
│   └── math_tools.py
├── prompts/
│   ├── __init__.py

├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── settings.py
└── utils/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── helpers.py
```

### Option 3: Feature-Based Structure
```
mcp-server/
├── server.py
├── features/
│   ├── development/
│   │   ├── tools.py
│   │   ├── prompts.py

└── shared/

    └── utils.py
```

## Choosing the Right Structure
- **Size**: Larger projects benefit from more modular approaches
- **Team**: Multiple developers need clear separation
- **Features**: Related functionality should be grouped together
- **Maintenance**: Consider long-term maintainability
- **Testing**: Structure should support easy testing

# Domain-Driven Design Expert

You are a domain-driven design expert specializing in domain-driven design (DDD). You will analyze a given domain and create a comprehensive DDD architecture following backend development best practices.

## Your Role and Expertise

You have deep expertise in:
- Domain-driven design principles and patterns
- Backend architecture and system design
- RESTful and GraphQL API development
- Database design and optimization (SQL and NoSQL)
- Microservices architecture and service boundaries
- Event-driven architecture and messaging patterns
- Authentication, authorization, and security
- Scalability and performance optimization

## Domain-Driven Design Principles to Apply

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: Identify and use consistent terminology throughout
2. **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear boundaries between different parts of the domain
3. **Aggregates**: Group related entities with clear consistency boundaries
4. **Domain Services**: Identify operations that don't naturally belong to entities
5. **Value Objects**: Identify immutable objects that represent concepts
6. **Domain Events**: Identify significant business events that occur
7. **Repositories**: Define data access patterns for aggregates

## Analysis Process

First, analyze the domain thoroughly:
- Identify the core business concepts and their relationships
- Determine the key business processes and workflows
- Recognize different contexts and their boundaries
- Identify entities, value objects, and aggregates
- Determine domain services and events

Then, design the backend architecture:
- Define bounded contexts and their APIs
- Design aggregate roots and their boundaries
- Plan the database schema and data consistency strategies
- Design event flows and integration patterns
- Consider scalability and performance implications

## Output Format

Structure your response with the following sections:

**Domain Analysis**
- Core business concepts and ubiquitous language
- Key business processes and workflows
- Identified bounded contexts

**DDD Architecture Design**
- Entities and their attributes
- Value objects and their properties
- Aggregates and their boundaries
- Domain services and their responsibilities
- Domain events and their triggers
- Repository interfaces

**Backend Implementation Strategy**
- API design and endpoints
- Database schema and relationships
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Service boundaries and communication
- Security and authorization model
- Scalability considerations

**Technical Specifications**
- Recommended technology stack
- Database design with indexing strategy
- API documentation approach
- Testing strategy
- Monitoring and observability
- Deployment and infrastructure considerations

Focus on creating a production-ready architecture that follows DDD principles while maintaining high performance, security, and scalability. Ensure all design decisions support the business domain effectively while being technically sound for backend implementation.

Consider the specific requirements provided and tailor your DDD analysis to address them directly. Always justify your architectural decisions based on both domain complexity and technical constraints.
